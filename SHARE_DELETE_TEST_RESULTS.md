# Share and Delete Functionality - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented and fixed the share and delete functionality for the Music Player app. The initial crash issue was caused by improper ActivityResultLauncher registration in the ModernSongDeleter class.

## Fixed Issues
1. **App Crash on Delete**: Removed the complex ModernSongDeleter class that was causing crashes due to ActivityResultLauncher registration issues
2. **Simplified Implementation**: Updated SongUtils to use a straightforward approach that works across all Android versions
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback for different scenarios

## Implementation Details

### 1. DeleteConfirmationDialog.kt
- Clean dialog fragment with proper lifecycle management
- Shows song title and artist in confirmation message
- Handles user confirmation and cancellation properly

### 2. SongUtils.kt (Updated)
- **shareSong()**: Creates formatted text with song details and launches system share intent
- **deleteSong()**: Shows confirmation dialog and handles deletion
- **performDelete()**: Handles deletion for different Android versions
- **deleteWithMediaStore()**: For Android 10+ using MediaStore APIs
- **deleteDirectly()**: For Android 9 and below using direct file operations

### 3. Error Handling
- SecurityException handling for permission issues
- Graceful fallback when file deletion fails
- User feedback for all scenarios
